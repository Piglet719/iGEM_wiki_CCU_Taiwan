            <h3 id="h3_bro">Project Description</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We chose dengue fever as our topic because it is listed as a top 10 health threat by WHO, and Taiwan is in the region under the threat of dengue fever.</li>
                <li>Since there is no effective medicine for dengue fever, our main goal is to detect the dengue virus early to keep patients from developing severe symptoms.</li>
                <li>We found that the interaction between C-type lectin domain, family 5, member A (CLEC5A) and E protein is the key leading to severe dengue. We developed a detection kit based on this interaction.</li>
                <li>We produced peptides using a PCR technique, LAE, which could massively produce peptides as the detection agents in the detection kit.</li>
                <li>We used Rosetta to simulate the interactions between the peptides of tandem-repeated sequence (PTRSs) with E protein to confirm our proposed design.</li>
                <li>We consulted with professional experts and governmental agencies to make the design of our detection kit more effective.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
