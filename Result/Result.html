            <h2>Linear Array Epitope</h2>
            <p>The results of template-repeated PCR (TR-PCR), shown in Figure 1, indicate that the length of the tandem-repeated sequence (TRS) varies with the concentration of the primer. We found the typical trend that the lower the concentration of primer, the higher the number of repeats of the TR-PCR products. However, the product concentration decreases when the primer concentration increases. In our project, the optimal primer concentrations are 0.2 μM for TRS-151*7 and 0.08 μM for TRS-110*3.</p>

            <p>TRS-110*3 and TRS-151*7 obtained from TR-PCR were transferred to adaptor PCR (AD-PCR). The ladders shown in Figure 2 are the products obtained from AD-PCR. The sequences ranging in size from 200-400 bp and 50-200 bp, identified as TA-151 and TA-110, respectively, were extracted and ligated to TA vectors. Mutiple bands found in the results of AD-PCR due to the fact that there were several sites available for ligation of the adapter. Therefore, various lengths of sequences were generated during AD-PCR. These ligated sequences were then successfully transformed into DH5α competent cells. The colonies shown in Figure 3 suggest the bacteria survives due to the antimicrobial peptides (AMP) in the TA vector.</p>

            <h2>Envelope Protein (E protein)</h2>
            <p>A plasmid containing the whole structural protein of the dengue virus was obtained from National Health Research Institute. The Envelope protein (E protein) with two HA tags from the plasmid were amplified using PCR. Figure 6 shows that the sequence of the E protein with the HA tags were amplified, matching the expected size of 1,551 bp.</p>

            <h2>Conjugations of Primary Amines to the Glass Fiber Membranes</h2>
            <p>We expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a mock E protein to show that that after modification, the glass fiber membrane can bind to the primary amines (side-chain amines) from a peptide or protein. We appreciate Mingdao iGEM 2020, who generously provided us with a plasmid containing the green fluorescent protein gene (GFPmut1, BBa_K1159311). The modified glass fiber membranes were immersed in GFP supernatant from the culture medium for 30 mins to form amide bonds. To verify that the experiments work, we measured the intensity of the fluorescence from GFP using a Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (also provided by Mingdao iGEM 2020). The intensity of membrane reaction with 0.5x and 1x GFP supernatant are shown in Figure 18. We carefully washed the membranes with double-distilled water after the reaction. The intensity was about twice as strong in the 1x supernatant as the 0.5x one, suggesting the conjugation experiments were successful. We also performed the same experiment with non-modified glass fiber membranes as a control, and the intensity of fluorescence is within the range of measurement error.</p>

            <h3>Avoiding the aggregation of AuNPs</h3>
            <p>To conjugate the peptides to the AuNPs, pre-treatment of the AuNPs is necessary. However, during this process, aggregation of AuNPs could happen, which would result in failure of the experiment. We measured the sizes of AuNPs using dynamic light scattering shown in Figure 20.</p>
            <br>
            <p>First, we used MUA/MCH to modify 13-nm AuNPs by adding carboxylic groups to the surface. However, the AuNPs aggregated to a size of about 1,800 nm after we applied the EDC/NHS treatment. We found that if we replaced EDC with DCC, the size of AuNPs aggregation was reduced to about 350 nm. But 350 nm is not small enough, so we further tried replacing MUA/MCH with MHA /SB thiol, which was then treated with EDC/NHS. We obtained a significantly smaller size of 90 nm. We used these particles for the following experiments.</p>

            <h3>Conjugations of primary amines to AuNPs</h3>
            <p>As a proof of concept that we are able to form the covalent bonds between the primary amines (from the PTRS) and AuNPs, we tried to conjugate the DNA primers (TRS-110R*7, BBa_K3648007) with the modified AuNPs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We used Raman spectrometer verify if the experiments worked. We found that with the DNA conjugation, the Raman signals have a significant decrease (Figure 21). Although we have no model to explain this effect, we believe it resulted from interactions with the DNA, suggesting DNA can bind to AuNPs.</p>
