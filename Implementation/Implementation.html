            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>We hope to manufacture a dengue virus detection kit which is convenient, fast, and effective. We expect that by detecting the dengue virus precisely, medical care and epidemic control of dengue could be undertaken at early stage, which could prevent dengue from developing into a severe and life-threatening situation.</p>

                <br>
                <p>According to statistical data provided by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC), from 2011 to 2019, the number of tests conducted for dengue diagnosis fell between 2,700 and 9,300. These numbers show the basic need for our detection kit. Based on the outbreaks in 2014 and 2015, the need for detection kits could reach 70,000 during a dengue outbreak.</p>
                <br>
                <p>By promotion of our product along with the spread of epidemics due to global warming, the demand for our product will increase continuously in the future.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Imported cases are the main contributors to dengue epidemics in Taiwan. Patients who have been to a dengue affected foreign country and reported being bitten by mosquitoes may bring the virus back to Taiwan, which may result in a local outbreak thorough the local transmission.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The number of imported dengue cases in Taiwan is growing every year. In 2018, the total number of indigenous cases was 183, while imported cases numbered 350. In 2019, the imported cases increased to 540 while there were only 100 indigenous cases . The number of imported cases greatly surpasses the number of local cases and has become the main reason for Taiwan dengue outbreaks.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Thus, fever screening stations are set up by TCDC at airports and harbors. Everyone going through immigration will undergo infrared temperature detection. Anyone entering Taiwan who shows an abnormal temperature has to take a dengue rapid detection immediately. In Taiwan, about 70% of the cases of imported notifiable infectious diseases were dengue fever, and 40-50% of imported dengue fever cases were effectively detected by the fever screening.</p>

                    <p>Besides individual diagnostics, our product could also be used in vector surveillance in the environment. We could determine the vector infection rate in the environment by collecting and testing mosquitoes. Currently, nearly 3,350 residential areas conduct dengue vector surveillance every month under the auspices of the Environmental Protection Bureau. Thus, our product could be used to test the infection rate of vector at the same time.</p>

            <h2>How To Do</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Patent application: Class II medical device that uses peptides to detect the E protein of dengue virus particles.</li>
                <li>Quality test of the product:</li>
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Functionality test in laboratory.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sensitivity: use whole virus particles (produced by a cooperating laboratory) to conduct the test.</li>
                        <li>Specificity: use other flaviviruses which are in the same family as dengue virus (also obtained from a cooperating laboratory).</li>
                        <li>Repeatability: conduct the test using multiple detection kits and different operators to ensure our product gets the same result.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Use simulated blood samples (from a cooperating hospital) to repeat the functionality tests of the product.</li>
                    <li>Use real blood samples (from a cooperating hospital) to conduct the functionality tests of the product, using double blind tests of patientsâ€™ blood samples and healthy blood samples.</li>
                    <li>Test the product in comparison with current detection methods.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>Estimated time: 2 years. After producing the virus at the cooperating laboratory, we will conduct the first test in the first year and repeat the test a year later to ensure the stability of product. The tests will be done during the peak dengue infection period (summer).</p>
                <br>
                <li>Medical device license application:</li>
                <p>Dengue virus detection kit is classified as a Class II medical device. It requires review and verification by Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) to obtain a medical device license to be sold and used in Taiwan. Thus, our next step is to apply for medical device license from TFDA.</li>
